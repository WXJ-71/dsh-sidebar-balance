# @local/dsh-sidebar-balance

Display name in the plugin page: **侧边栏余额** / **Sidebar Balance** (from
`locale/zh.json` and `locale/en.json`; without them the card falls back to the
raw package name).

Shows the DeepSeek account balance at the foot of the Harness sidebar, above the
Settings row, and signs the Harness into a DeepSeek Platform account from the
browser. It reads the built-in account Remote (`account.getState`,
`account.getBalance`, `account.startSignIn`, `account.cancelSignIn`), so it never
talks to the Platform itself and needs no configuration.

## Why this plugin exists

The shipped account UI (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-settings-account`) registers
only in the Desktop renderer — its `apply()` starts with
`if (!("dshDesktop" in globalThis)) return`. In a browser profile there is
therefore no account page and no way to sign in, even though the Host half
(`dsh-deepseek-account-platform`) supports a `loginSource: 'web'` PKCE flow whose
callback lands on the loopback Web server. This plugin adds the missing entry
point.

## Where it renders

One entry in the `sidebar.footer.action` slot (`id: account-balance`):

- **signed in** — wallet glyph (see `WalletIcon`: a 1.25:1 billfold with a snap
  clasp, drawn from the owner's two reference icons), `余额`/`Balance`, and the
  topped-up amount (`¥12.34`, or `<0.01` for a positive sub-cent balance);
  clicking opens a panel with the topped-up and granted wallets, a refresh
  action, and the account's Usage / Top-up links.
- **signed out** — wallet glyph with `未登录`/`Not signed in`; the panel offers
  `登录`/`Sign in`.
- **signing in** — the state reads `等待登录完成…`/`Waiting for sign-in…` in the
  brand color while an attempt is in flight, with `打开授权页` and `取消` actions.
- **read failed** — the state turns into the error color and the panel carries
  the Remote error text; polling keeps retrying.
- **collapsed sidebar** — a 36px circular icon-only button, like the Cordis
  panel beside it.
- **billing indicator** — the wallet glyph itself is tinted by the window that
  is open right now: red for peak, green for off-peak, in both themes and in the
  icon-only rail chip as well. The chip's tooltip names the window
  (`· 计费高峰时段` / `· 空闲优惠时段`).

- **Moonshot AI CN** — the panel carries a second section with the Moonshot
  open-platform wallet: available balance plus the cash/voucher breakdown,
  refreshed on the same 60-second poll, and the chip falls back to it when
  there is no DeepSeek wallet. The page never sees the key — the Host half
  reads `MOONSHOTAI_CN_API_KEY` (falling back to `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`) through
  the credential seam and calls `api.moonshot.cn` itself.

State refreshes on mount, every 60 seconds, and whenever the tab becomes
visible. While a sign-in attempt is pending the cadence is 2 seconds, so the
chip flips to the balance by itself once the browser finishes.

## The billing indicator

DeepSeek bills the standard rate in two UTC windows, Monday to Friday, and the
discount rate in every other hour — **weekends and Chinese public holidays in
full** ([pricing](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing)):

| Rate | When (UTC) |
| --- | --- |
| peak (wallet red) | 01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00, Mon–Fri, except CN holidays |
| off-peak (wallet green) | every other hour, all weekend, and every CN holiday |

`peakAt(date)` in `client.js` is a pure function of the instant, so the tint is
right whenever the page re-renders, and `useOffPeak` only exists to re-render at
the edges: one timer re-arms for the next 00:00/01:00/04:00/06:00/10:00 UTC
boundary, and a `visibilitychange` listener re-reads the clock because phones
freeze timers while the tab is backgrounded. The window is evaluated in UTC, so
the device's own timezone never changes the tint.

Holidays come from the State Council's yearly arrangement, listed per year in
`CN_HOLIDAYS` as `MM-DD` (2026 is 国办发明电〔2025〕7号). The table is the one
part that goes stale: a year that is missing falls back to the weekday rule,
which claims peak on a holiday rather than promising a discount that is not
there. Add the next year's dates from
<https://www.gov.cn/zhengce/zhengceku/> when they are published each November.
Shifting a weekend to a workday does not matter: DeepSeek bills weekends
off-peak in full, `调休` or not.

`prefers-reduced-motion` has nothing to switch off here: the tint is static, so
the window reads the same either way.

The tint is the theme's own state token, painted through `currentColor`:
`--dsw-alias-state-error-primary` for peak and `--dsw-alias-state-success-primary`
for off-peak. Every stroke of the glyph carries it, so the wallet reads as one
colour rather than a tinted detail. Reusing the tokens keeps it legible in light
and dark without a colour of its own, and the icon-only rail chip takes the same
tint — there it is the only signal the chip has.

Two rules set it, and they sit after `.dsh-sidebar-balance_icon` in the sheet so
they win on the element they share with it. The wallet's blank left panel, which
used to hold the billing dots, stays blank.

## Moonshot balance

The panel's `Moonshot AI CN` section rides the same poll as the DeepSeek read.
The page never sees the key: the Host half registers one same-origin route,
`/dsh-sidebar-balance/moonshot.json`, which resolves `MOONSHOTAI_CN_API_KEY`
(then `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`) through `ctx.credentials.resolve` per read — the
credential seam's rule, so a rotated key reaches the next poll without a
restart — and calls `GET {baseUrl}/users/me/balance`. The route answers the
available balance plus the cash/voucher breakdown, cached for 55 seconds so a
burst of polls shares one upstream read; `?refresh=1` bypasses the cache (the
panel's refresh button).

Every request passes through Connection's `requestRejection`, the same
browser-session trust fence the built-in JSON routes use, so only a page this
Harness would serve can read it. The four statuses the page renders are `ready`
(amounts), `no-credential` (a hint naming the missing ref), `failed` (the
upstream or network error text, trimmed to 200 chars), and `disabled` (the
Config turned the section off).

### Surviving a flaky resolver

Measured on a machine whose DNS intermittently stalls: a cold `dns.lookup` took
**7.3 s** while the next one answered in **10 ms**, and undici fails the request
at its own ~10 s *connect* timeout — before this plugin's `fetchTimeoutMs` can
matter. Two behaviours follow from that, and both are deliberately asymmetric
with the happy path:

- **A transport failure gets exactly one retry**, 500 ms later, and only when
  the cause is one a second attempt can fix (`UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`,
  `ETIMEDOUT`, `ECONNRESET`, `EAI_AGAIN`, …). A warm resolver answers that retry
  instantly, so the read succeeds where a single attempt would have reported an
  outage. Deterministic causes (`ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNREFUSED`), HTTP errors, and
  this plugin's own timeout abort are *not* retried — a second round trip would
  only delay an honest failure.
- **Failures are cached for 5 seconds, not `cacheTtlMs`.** Replaying a blip for
  the rest of the read interval is exactly when someone is staring at the panel
  wondering why it still says unavailable; with the short failure TTL the next
  poll shows the recovery instead.

The error text also carries the syscall-level cause (`fetch failed /
UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`), because undici reports every transport failure as the
bare string `fetch failed` and hides the real one in `cause.cause` — without it
an outage is indistinguishable from a bad address.

With no DeepSeek wallet the chip falls back to the Moonshot available balance.
That fallback keeps the wallet glyph **neutral**: the red/green tint is
DeepSeek's billing window and is dropped — from the icon and from the tooltip —
whenever the chip is speaking for Moonshot. The section carries its own
`更新于` stamp, because the two providers refresh on independent reads and one
shared stamp would claim a freshness the Moonshot number may not have.

## Failures and keyboard

Every failure carries a **code**, and the panel renders the code's localized
text rather than raw provider English. The codes are the Host route's (`timeout`,
`payload`, `http`, `network`, `unknown`), this half's own (`host-route`,
`wallet`), and the account Remote's documented ones (`expired`, `storage`,
`protocol`). A code with no dictionary entry still prints whatever text arrived
— an unmapped message is worth more to a reader than a generic replacement — and
where a localized line and a provider message both exist, the provider's words
follow a `·` separator and stay in the element's `title`, so a report stays
diagnosable.

The panel follows the host's modal-layer conventions (its `useModalLayer`, whose
focusable selector this plugin copies rather than redefining):

- opening moves focus into the panel once it has been measured — the panel
  renders hidden until its position is known, and a hidden element cannot take
  focus;
- Tab wraps inside the panel instead of walking the page behind it;
- Escape closes only while this panel owns focus, so a host modal opened on top
  keeps its own Escape;
- closing hands focus back to whatever opened the panel, unless the close came
  from clicking something else — that click owns focus then.

It deliberately declares `aria-modal="true"` **without** a scrim: interaction
and keyboard ownership match a modal, but the popover still dismisses on a click
anywhere else and never dims the app.

## Config

Both halves are driven by one row config, written in your profile's
`cordis.patch.yml`. Defaults suit the common case, so the row needs no config
at all:

```yaml
- id: sidebar-balance
  name: '@local/dsh-sidebar-balance'
  config:
    keyRefs: ['MOONSHOTAI_CN_API_KEY', 'MOONSHOT_API_KEY']
    baseUrl: https://api.moonshot.cn/v1
    cacheTtlMs: 55000
    fetchTimeoutMs: 20000
    pollIntervalMs: 60000
    showMoonshot: true
```

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keyRefs` | both Moonshot refs | Credential references tried in order; the first configured one wins |
| `baseUrl` | `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1` | API root; the wallet endpoint is `${baseUrl}/users/me/balance` |
| `cacheTtlMs` | `55000` | How long one upstream read is served to every poll |
| `fetchTimeoutMs` | `20000` | Hard ceiling on one upstream read |
| `pollIntervalMs` | `60000` | Cadence the page polls both providers at |
| `showMoonshot` | `true` | Off hides the section; the route then answers `disabled` without touching credentials or the network |

The page cannot read a Host plugin's Config, so the route echoes the two
client-relevant fields (`pollIntervalMs`, `showMoonshot`) on every answer and
the panel adopts them — which is why changing the cadence or hiding the section
takes effect on the next poll instead of needing a reload.

## The sign-in flow

1. The panel's `登录`/`Sign in` action calls
   `account.startSignIn(client, window.location.origin, 'web')`.
2. The Host runs the PKCE attempt, registers the browser callback route
   `/oauth/callback` on its Web server, and returns the attempt with an
   `authorizeUrl`; the plugin opens it in a new tab.
3. Platform approval redirects the tab to
   `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/oauth/callback?code=…&state=…`, which the Host
   exchanges and stores as the `deepseek-account-platform/default` grant.
4. The next 2-second poll sees `credential-stored`, reads the wallet, and the
   chip shows the amount.

`window.open` runs in the same turn as the click, so it is not treated as a
popup; if the browser blocks it anyway the panel says so and offers the
`打开授权页` button instead. Cancelling calls `account.cancelSignIn(attempt.id)`;
if the panel is closed mid-attempt the attempt stays alive on the Host and the
next poll adopts its id again.

## Files

- `package.json` — bundle manifest: `dsh.bundle.patch`, the display `icon`, the
  `locale/*.json` and `package.json` exports the metadata reader resolves, plus
  the Client declaration (`platform: web`, `immediately`, and the load-order
  `inject`).
- `cordis.patch.yml` — inserts the single Host row for this package.
- `locale/en.json`, `locale/zh.json` — the `meta.title` / `meta.description`
  shown on the plugin card and component rows.
- `icon.png` — the plugin-card artwork: a 241×256 RGBA PNG (90.9 KiB) cut down
  from a 1155×1229 source that already carries a transparent background. Only
  the plugin list, bundle list, and inventory rows read it; the sidebar chip
  keeps its inline wallet glyph in `client.js`.
- `index.js` — Host half: one authenticated same-origin route,
  `/dsh-sidebar-balance/moonshot.json`, resolving the Moonshot credential
  through `ctx.credentials` and reading the wallet from `api.moonshot.cn` with
  a short cache, so the key never leaves the Host. It also declares the
  plugin's `Config`.
- `client.js` — the browser half: the `sidebar.footer.action` registration, the
  chip and account panel, the Moonshot section, the sign-in flow, inline styles, the
  inline `WalletIcon` / `RefreshIcon` glyphs, the `peakAt` / `useOffPeak`
  billing-window helpers, and the `sidebar.balance` dictionaries (en/zh).

## Maintenance

`clientMetadata()` in `client.js` sends `x-client-version` to the Platform. It
pins the Harness version this bundle was authored against (`0.2.0-rc.2`); bump
it after upgrading the Harness.

`package.json` declares `peerDependencies: { "@deepseek-ai/dsh": "^0.2.0-rc.2" }`,
which is what the manager's compatibility preflight reads: outside that range the
plugin is refused at install time instead of failing silently later. The matching
`peerDependenciesMeta` entry marks it optional so a package manager never tries to
fetch a whole dsh runtime for it.

Do **not** judge that range by default `semver` semantics. `dsh-app-boot`
evaluates it as `semver.satisfies(runtime, range, { includePrerelease: true })`,
and `includePrerelease` is what lets one caret range cover the whole `0.2.x`
line **including its prereleases**:

| runtime | `^0.2.0-rc.2` with `includePrerelease` | without |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0.2.0-rc.2` | covered | covered |
| `0.2.1-alpha.1` | **covered** | not covered |
| `0.2.9` | covered | covered |
| `0.3.0-rc.1` | not covered | not covered |

So the range already spans `0.2.0-rc.2` through the end of the `0.2` line; the
next real decision point is `0.3.0`, not the next `0.2.x` prerelease. The
`test-sidebar-balance-host.mjs` peer-range block re-checks this table against the
installed runtime so the reasoning above cannot silently rot.

A `link:` install into a profile keeps this directory live: editing `client.js`
is picked up by Client HMR when the web dev watcher is running, and by a page
refresh otherwise. Changes to `cordis.patch.yml` rows need a bundle install (or a
Harness restart) to take effect. See `INSTALL.md` for the install itself.

The card icon is the exception, and it is not the case the note below covers:
`readPluginMeta` resolves `./package.json` once and then re-reads that file with
`readFileSync` on every call, inlining the icon bytes as a `data:` URL. So
replacing `icon.png` — or pointing `icon` at another file that already sits
inside the manifest directory — lands on the next plugin-list fetch, which the
page performs on mount. Adding the `icon` field, a new `exports` entry, or
`locale/*.json` for the first time is different: Node caches the package's
resolved exports map for the life of the process, so the running Harness keeps
reading the previous map — and therefore keeps showing the package-name and
default-artwork fallbacks — until `dsh web` is restarted. Verify new text or a
new icon address without waiting by calling `readPluginMeta` in a fresh process:

```sh
node --input-type=module -e "import { readPluginMeta } from '@deepseek-ai/dsh-app-boot'; \
  console.log(JSON.stringify(readPluginMeta('@local/dsh-sidebar-balance', 'file://' + process.env.DSH_PROFILE_DIR + '/'), null, 2))"
```

`icon.png` was cut from a 1155×1229 RGBA source with a transparent background:
fit to a 256px box with Lanczos, landing at 241×256 and about 89 KiB. The manifest
cap is 256 KiB, so a 512px render is refused and a 384px one only just fits.
Nothing else in this package depends on that source.

## Diagnosing a failed sign-in

The panel prints the Remote error verbatim. Useful mappings:

- `account start failed` / `protocol` — `startSignIn` rejected the callback
  origin. The Host accepts only `http://localhost|127.0.0.1|[::1]:<port>` with no
  path, and the authorize URL must be `<platformOrigin>/dsh/authorize`.
- `expired` — the attempt outlived `attemptTimeoutMs` (10 minutes by default) or
  the Browser was closed before consent.
- `network` — the Host could not reach `https://platform.deepseek.com`.
- `storage` — a stored grant exists but does not parse; `signOut` (or deleting
  the `deepseek-account-platform/default` record in `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`)
  clears it.
